# SQL-Collection

This is just a collection of SQL Scripts (aimed at MS-SQL 2016+). Most of these scripts related to admin/optimization tasks. 
Nothing mind-blowing, just a place to store a bunch of useful stuff with code that is at least marginally trustworthy.

Some of these have obviously been built with the help of an LLM (various) - the main prompt is captured here as well. Feel free to adjust/improve.
